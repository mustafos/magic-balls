# Magic Balls
Welcome to Magic Balls, a thrilling adventure built with SpriteKit! 

Dive into an exhilarating adventure with our SpriteKit game! Tap the start button to kick off the action-packed excitement. Once initiated, the button vanishes, unleashing a thrilling cascade as the ball descends amidst a flurry of platforms. Your mission? Guide the ball's descent by tilting your device left or right using the accelerometer.

As you navigate the ball's trajectory, be on the lookout for platforms that span the width of the screen. Maneuver the ball to slip through the gaps and avoid collision. But beware, everything except the ball ascends at a rate 25 times slower than its descent, adding a heart-pounding challenge to your journey.

The stakes are high: fail to keep the ball moving, and you risk it perching atop a platform, inching closer to the game-ending top of the screen. Lose before 30 seconds elapse, and face defeat. However, if you manage to stay in the game for 30 seconds or more, victory is yours!

Experience the thrill of triumph or the sting of defeat on our immersive game-over screen, presented through a full-screen web view. Winners and losers are treated to distinct URLs, providing a tailored experience for each outcome.
